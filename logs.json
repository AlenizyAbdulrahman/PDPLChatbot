{"question": "Dose accessing the data without sharing it on my infrastructure consider as processing   ", "answer": "Accessing personal data without sharing it can be considered as processing under the Saudi Arabia Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL). According to Article 10, the Controller may only process Personal Data for the purposes for which they have been collected, and processing includes any operation performed on personal data, including access. Therefore, if you are accessing personal data, it falls under the definition of processing, regardless of whether it is shared or not. \n\nIf you have further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!", "sources": [{"source": "ImplementingRegulation", "article": "Article 21"}, {"source": "PDPL", "article": "Article 10"}, {"source": "ImplementingRegulation", "article": "Article 18"}, {"source": "PDPL", "article": "Article 15"}]}
{"question": "can i make more than one assesment for thirdparty depending on how the third party going to do with the data and the data itself? if yes give me example", "answer": "Yes, you can conduct multiple assessments for a third party based on how they will handle the data and the nature of the data itself. According to Article 25 of the Saudi Arabia Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL), the Controller is required to prepare a written and documented assessment of the potential impacts and risks that may affect the Data Subject as a result of Personal Data Processing. This assessment must consider various factors, including the nature of the data being processed and the specific circumstances of the processing activity.\n\nFor example, in the banking sector, if a bank is considering sharing customer financial data with a third-party analytics provider, the bank should conduct an impact assessment that evaluates the risks associated with sharing sensitive financial information. If the analytics provider will process this data using new technologies or for purposes that could significantly impact the privacy of the Data Subjects, the bank may need to conduct a more detailed assessment. Additionally, if the third party intends to link this data with other datasets obtained from different sources, a separate assessment may be warranted to address the cumulative risks involved.\n\nThis approach ensures that the bank remains compliant with the PDPL and adequately protects the rights and interests of its customers.", "sources": [{"source": "ImplementingRegulation", "article": "Article 25"}, {"source": "PDPL", "article": "Article 27"}, {"source": "ImplementingRegulation", "article": "Article 3"}, {"source": "ImplementingRegulation", "article": "Article 15"}]}
{"question": "is the scale of the data is important to do assessment for third-party?", "answer": "Yes, the scale of the data is important when conducting an assessment for a third party. According to Article 25 of the Saudi Arabia Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL), the Controller is required to prepare a written and documented assessment of the potential impacts and risks that may affect the Data Subject as a result of Personal Data Processing. Specifically, the assessment must consider various factors, including the scale of the data being processed.\n\nFor instance, if a bank is assessing a third-party service provider that will process a large volume of customer data, the bank must evaluate the potential risks associated with this large-scale processing. This may include considerations of how the volume of data could increase the likelihood of data breaches or misuse, and the corresponding impact on the privacy of the Data Subjects. \n\nThus, the scale of the data directly influences the depth and focus of the impact assessment to ensure adequate protection of personal data.", "sources": [{"source": "ImplementingRegulation", "article": "Article 25"}, {"source": "ImplementingRegulation", "article": "Article 3"}, {"source": "ImplementingRegulation", "article": "Article 8"}, {"source": "PDPL", "article": "Article 22"}]}
